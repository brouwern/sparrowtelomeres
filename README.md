The goal of sparrowtelomeres is to replicate the analyses in Meillere et al. 2015 "Traffic noise exposure affects telomere length in nestling house sparrows" from Biology Letters (https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2015.0559).  The package also contains materials in the form of R vignettes for using the paper as a case study in undergraduate general biology, ecology, and statistics classes.
